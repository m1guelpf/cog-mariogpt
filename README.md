# MarioGPT: Generating Super Mario Levels with Language Models
[![Replicate](https://replicate.com/m1guelpf/mario-gpt/badge)](https://replicate.com/m1guelpf/mario-gpt) 


This repository contains a modified version of the [MarioGPT source code](https://github.com/shyamsn97/mario-gpt), which adds support for token streaming. It's packaged as a [Cog model](https://github.com/replicate/cog) to be run on [Replicate](https://replicate.com).

## Usage

First, make sure you've got the [latest version of Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog#install) installed.

Build the container image:

```sh
cog build
```

Now you can run predictions on the model:

```sh
cog predict -i "prompt=many pipes, many enemies, some blocks, high elevation"
```
